# Flappy Bird VHDL Project

## Overview
This is a Flappy Bird implementation in VHDL for the Nexys 4 FPGA development board. The game utilizes a VGA display with a resolution of 320x240 pixels for a classic gaming experience. The user controls the game using a keypad PMOD connected to the Nexys 4 board.

## Features
- Flappy Bird game implemented in VHDL.
- VGA display with a resolution of 320x240 pixels.
- User input via a keypad PMOD connected to the Nexys 4 board.

## Development Team
This project was 100% developed by El Mehdi Marzoug and Romain Losilla, as part of our VHDL Project at Enseirb-matmeca engineering school.

## Hardware Requirements
- Nexys 4 FPGA development board
- VGA display monitor
- Keypad PMOD
